product_goal:
  statement: "Enable zero-configuration usage of treesitter-ls: users can start the LSP server and get syntax highlighting for any supported language without manual setup."
  mvp_status: COMPLETE
  mvp_definition: |
    Minimum Viable Zero-Config Experience:
    1. User starts treesitter-ls with no initialization options
    2. User opens a .lua file (or any supported language)
    3. treesitter-ls automatically:
       a. Detects the language from file extension (via LSP languageId)
       b. Installs the parser and queries if missing (autoInstall: true by default)
       c. Uses default searchPaths (~/.local/share/treesitter-ls)
       d. Provides semantic highlighting
    4. Power users can still override with explicit configuration

    title: "Consolidate query resolution API in QueryLoader"
    status: draft
    user_story: |
      As a maintainer,
      I want to simplify the QueryLoader API,
      so that there is a single clear entry point for query resolution.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - criterion: "AC1: Single resolve_query method exists"
        verification: "grep -c 'pub fn resolve_query\\b' src/language/query_loader.rs returns 1"
      - criterion: "AC2: resolve_query_with_inheritance removed or made private"
        verification: "grep -c 'pub fn resolve_query_with_inheritance' src/language/query_loader.rs returns 0"
      - criterion: "AC3: All tests pass"
        verification: "cargo test --lib -- query_loader"
      - criterion: "AC4: No REVIEW comments remain in file"
        verification: "grep -c '// REVIEW:' src/language/query_loader.rs returns 0"
    notes: |
      Review finding: Consider making visited parameter optional in resolve_query_recursive
      to unify resolve_query_with_inheritance and resolve_query_recursive.

      Current state (line 12):
      - resolve_query_with_inheritance - public entry point that creates HashSet
      - resolve_query_recursive - private helper with visited parameter

      Potential approach: Make visited parameter optional (Option<&mut HashSet>),
      allowing a single public method named simply "resolve_query".

      Status: draft - needs investigation to confirm approach is sound
