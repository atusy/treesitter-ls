product_goal:
  statement: "Enable zero-configuration usage of treesitter-ls: users can start the LSP server and get syntax highlighting for any supported language without manual setup."
  mvp_status: COMPLETE
  mvp_definition: |
    Minimum Viable Zero-Config Experience:
    1. User starts treesitter-ls with no initialization options
    2. User opens a .lua file (or any supported language)
    3. treesitter-ls automatically:
       a. Detects the language from file extension (via LSP languageId)
       b. Installs the parser and queries if missing (autoInstall: true by default)
       c. Uses default searchPaths (~/.local/share/treesitter-ls)
       d. Provides semantic highlighting
    4. Power users can still override with explicit configuration

      ## Root Cause Analysis
      When autoInstall is enabled (default) and parser already exists:
      1. install_parser() returns Err(AlreadyExists)
      2. InstallResult.is_success() returns false
      3. reload_language_after_install() is NOT called
      4. Parser never gets loaded into coordinator

      With autoInstall=false, the auto-install path is skipped entirely,
      so normal loading works correctly.

      ## Fix Options (in order of preference)
      C) Skip install_parser if parser file exists (check before calling)
         - Simplest: avoids calling install_parser entirely
         - Check parser_file.exists() before install_language_async
      B) Check for AlreadyExists error and still call reload_language_after_install
         - Requires matching on error message string (fragile)
      A) Treat AlreadyExists as partial success in InstallResult
         - Changes InstallResult semantics (may have side effects)

      ## Files Affected
      - src/lsp/lsp_impl.rs (maybe_auto_install_language function)
      - src/install/mod.rs (InstallResult if option A chosen)
      - src/install/parser.rs (AlreadyExists error definition)

      ## TDD Approach
      1. RED: Write test that triggers auto-install when parser exists
      2. GREEN: Implement fix (option C recommended)
      3. REFACTOR: Clean up any redundant checks

    notes: |
      ## Root Cause Analysis
      When init_options is omitted, Neovim sends initializationOptions = {} (empty dict).
      The server parses this successfully, but search_paths is None/empty.

      The bug is in reload_language_after_install() at lsp_impl.rs:360-370:
      - It adds "data_dir/parsers" (plural) to search paths
      - But parser files are installed at "data_dir/parser" (singular)
      - So the language coordinator can't find the parser

      ## Fix
      Change lsp_impl.rs line 360: "parsers" -> "parser"
      (queries at line 367 is already correct)

      ## Files Affected

      ## Rationale (Dave Cheney's logging philosophy)
      - warn implies user action is needed
      - Most users cannot modify upstream nvim-treesitter queries
      - These messages are informational for query authors, not actionable warnings
      - info is appropriate for "interesting runtime events"

      ## Files Affected (5 log calls + 1 doc)
      - src/language/query_predicates.rs: 3 calls (lines 31, 39, 47)
        - Change: use log::warn -> use log::info
        - Change: warn! -> info! (3 occurrences)
      - src/language/injection.rs: 2 calls (lines 57, 108)
        - Change: log::warn! -> log::info! (2 occurrences)
      - docs/README.md: Update logging table row for treesitter_ls::query
        - Change: warn -> info in Level column

  notes: |
    ## Implementation Summary
    Changed 5 log calls from warn/eprintln to log::info! following Dave Cheney's
    logging philosophy:
    1. query_predicates.rs: Changed 3 eprintln! to log::info! with target treesitter_ls::query
    2. injection.rs: Changed 2 log::warn! to log::info! (kept target treesitter_ls::query)
    3. docs/README.md: Updated logging table and example from warn to info

    ## Rationale
    Query predicate issues (invalid lua-patterns, malformed #offset! directives) were
    logged as warnings, but they don't require user action. Most users cannot modify
    upstream nvim-treesitter queries. Following Dave Cheney's principle:
    - warn: user action needed
    - info: interesting runtime events

    These messages are informational for query authors, not actionable warnings for
    end users. Users running with RUST_LOG=warn would see these unnecessarily.

    outcome: "Changed query predicate log level from warn to info for better log hygiene and actionability"
    retrospective:
      what_went_well:
        - "Clear rationale based on Dave Cheney's logging philosophy"
        - "Simple, focused refactoring with single cohesive commit"
        - "All Definition of Done checks passed (199 unit tests + 20 E2E tests)"
        - "Documentation updated alongside code changes"
      what_to_improve:
        - "Initial PBI notes incorrectly stated warn! macros existed when actual code used eprintln!"
      insight: |
        Log level decisions should be based on actionability, not severity. Warnings imply
        user action is needed, while info is for interesting but non-actionable events.
        Query predicate issues are informational for query authors (who use nvim-treesitter),
        not actionable for end users of treesitter-ls. This distinction keeps RUST_LOG=warn
        output focused on truly actionable issues.

  - sprint: 39
    pbi: PBI-051
    outcome: "Fixed zero-config to work when init_options is completely omitted from Neovim LSP config"
    retrospective:
      what_went_well:
        - "Identified the deeper issue beyond the initial typo analysis"
        - "Single cohesive commit fixed all related issues (typo + initialization)"
        - "All Definition of Done checks passed (199 unit tests + 20 E2E tests)"
        - "Root cause analysis refined during implementation"
      what_to_improve:
        - "Initial PBI analysis was surface-level (typo) rather than systemic (initialization flow)"
      insight: |
        Bug analysis should examine the full execution flow, not just the immediate error location.
        The PBI identified a typo ("parsers" vs "parser"), but testing revealed the deeper issue:
        when no settings are loaded, apply_settings() was never called, leaving auto_install=false.
        Derived Default traits don't always match business requirements - zero-config requires
        auto_install=true, but bool's Default is false. The fix ensures settings are always
        applied with proper business defaults via the From<TreeSitterSettings> conversion.

  - sprint: 38
    pbi: PBI-049
    outcome: "Fixed zero-config auto-install when parsers already exist by adding parser_file_exists check before installation"
    retrospective:
      what_went_well:
        - "Root cause identified correctly - AlreadyExists error prevented reload"
        - "Simple, targeted fix (Option C) avoided complex changes to InstallResult"
        - "Discovered and fixed secondary bug with Lua empty table JSON serialization"
        - "All Definition of Done checks passed"
      what_to_improve:
        - "Consider adding integration test for the specific scenario (parser exists + autoInstall enabled)"
      insight: |
        When fixing auto-install issues, check the full flow from installation attempt through
        to language loading. The fix point was at the beginning (check before install) rather
        than at the error handling (treating AlreadyExists as success), which was simpler and
        less risky. Also discovered that vim.empty_dict() is needed for proper JSON object
        serialization from Lua.

      what_to_improve:

        Consolidation-type PBIs (API simplification, cleanup) naturally complete in single
        well-scoped refactoring commits. This is appropriate for pure structural changes
        with no behavioral changes - not a TDD violation but recognition of a distinct pattern.
