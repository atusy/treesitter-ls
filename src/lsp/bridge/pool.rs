//! Language server pool for downstream language servers.
//!
//! This module provides the LanguageServerPool which manages connections to
//! downstream language servers per ADR-0016 (Server Pool Coordination).
//!
//! # Server-Name-Based Pooling
//!
//! The pool is keyed by `server_name`, not by `languageId`. This enables:
//! - **Process sharing**: Multiple languages can share a single process
//!   (e.g., `typescript` and `typescriptreact` both mapping to `tsgo`)
//! - **Decoupling**: Language identity is separate from server identity
//!
//! Routing flow: `languageId` → `server_name` (via config) → connection
//!
//! # Key Types
//!
//! - [`LanguageServerPool`]: Main pool managing all downstream connections
//! - [`ConnectionHandle`]: Handle to a single downstream connection (ADR-0014)
//! - [`ConnectionState`]: State machine for connection lifecycle
