//! Outbound message types for the writer loop.
//!
//! This module provides the `OutboundMessage` enum that represents messages
//! to be sent to a downstream language server via the single-writer loop
//! (ADR-0015).
//!
//! All messages pass through the unified order queue to ensure FIFO ordering.
//! The writer task consumes these and writes to stdin.

use crate::lsp::bridge::protocol::RequestId;

/// Message to be sent to a downstream language server.
///
/// All messages pass through the unified order queue to ensure FIFO ordering
/// per ADR-0015. The writer task consumes these and writes to stdin.
///
/// The variants reflect whether the ResponseRouter tracks the message:
/// - `Untracked`: fire-and-forget (notifications, server-request responses)
/// - `Tracked`: request_id registered with ResponseRouter for cleanup on failure
