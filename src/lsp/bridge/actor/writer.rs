//! Writer task for downstream language server stdin.
//!
//! This module provides the single-writer actor that consumes from the
//! unified order queue and writes to the downstream server's stdin.
//!
//! # 3-Phase Shutdown Protocol
//!
//! The writer task supports graceful shutdown with a 3-phase protocol:
//!
//! 1. **Stop Signal**: Caller sends `()` on `stop_tx` to request shutdown
//! 2. **Idle Confirmation**: Writer sends `()` on `idle_tx` when queue is drained
//! 3. **Writer Return**: Writer sends itself on `writer_tx` for LSP shutdown sequence
//!
//! This protocol ensures:
//! - Pending messages are delivered before shutdown
//! - Caller can perform LSP shutdown/exit sequence with the returned writer
//! - Writer is always returned if possible (dedicated channel)
