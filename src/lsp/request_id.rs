//! Request ID capture for bridging upstream request IDs to downstream servers.
//!
//! This module provides a tower Service wrapper that captures the request ID
//! from incoming LSP requests and makes it available via task-local storage.
//! This enables downstream bridge requests to use the same ID as the upstream
//! client per ADR-0016 (Server Pool Coordination).
//!
//! # Cancel Forwarding
//!
//! The middleware also intercepts `$/cancelRequest` notifications and forwards
//! them to downstream language servers via the `CancelForwarder`. This ensures
//! that when a client cancels a request, the cancel is propagated to the
//! downstream server that is processing it.
//!
//! # Upstream Cancel Notification
//!
//! Handlers can subscribe to cancel notifications for their request ID using
//! `CancelForwarder::subscribe()`. When a `$/cancelRequest` arrives for that ID,
//! the subscriber is notified via a oneshot channel. This enables handlers to
//! immediately abort their work and return `RequestCancelled` error to the client.
