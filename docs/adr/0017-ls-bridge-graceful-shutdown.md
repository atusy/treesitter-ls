# ADR-0017: LS Bridge Graceful Shutdown

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Date** | 2026-01-06 |

## Context

ADR-0014 (Async Bridge Connection), ADR-0015 (Message Ordering), and ADR-0016 (Server Pool Coordination) establish the communication architecture but do not specify shutdown behavior.

### Critical Gaps Without Shutdown Specification

1. **No LSP shutdown handshake**: LSP protocol requires `shutdown` request → `exit` notification sequence for clean server termination
2. **Undefined operation disposal**: What happens to pending operations and queued requests during shutdown?
3. **No state for shutdown-in-progress**: ConnectionState (Initializing/Ready/Failed) has no "shutting down" state, creating race conditions
4. **Multi-connection coordination unspecified**: How to shut down multiple concurrent language servers (parallel vs sequential, timeout handling)

**Without Graceful Shutdown:**
- Servers may not flush buffers or save state
- Operations hang indefinitely or receive no error response
- Process cleanup may leak resources (zombie processes, lock files)
- LSP protocol violations may corrupt server caches

## Decision

**Implement two-tier graceful shutdown with LSP protocol compliance and fail-fast operation disposal.**

## Architecture

### Connection State for Shutdown

This ADR defines behavior for `Closing` and `Closed` states. See [ADR-0015 § Connection State Tracking](0015-ls-bridge-message-ordering.md#4-connection-state-tracking) for the complete ConnectionState enum.

**Shutdown-Specific Transitions:**
```
Ready → Closing          (graceful shutdown initiated)
Initializing → Closing   (abort initialization, shutdown)
Closing → Closed         (shutdown completed or timed out)
Failed → Closed          (skip shutdown handshake, cleanup only)
```

**Operation Gating in Closing State:**
- New operations: Reject with `REQUEST_FAILED` ("bridge: connection closing")
- Order queue: Continue draining (send queued operations)
- Pending responses: Wait for responses up to global timeout

### LSP Shutdown Handshake Sequence

Follow LSP specification's two-phase shutdown:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Phase 1: Graceful Shutdown                              │
│ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────    │
│ 1. Transition to Closing state                          │
│ 2. Send LSP shutdown request to server                  │
│ 3. Wait for shutdown response (until global timeout)    │
│ 4. Send LSP exit notification                           │
│ 5. Wait for process exit (until global timeout)         │
│ 6. Transition to Closed state                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                           │
                           │ Timeout expires
                           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Phase 2: Forced Shutdown                                │
│ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────│
│ 1. Send SIGTERM to server process                       │
│ 2. Wait for process death (implementation-defined)      │
│ 3. Send SIGKILL if still alive                          │
│ 4. Transition to Closed state                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Exception: Failed State Bypass**
```
Failed → Closed (skip LSP handshake)
├─ stdin unavailable (writer loop panicked or process crashed)
├─ Send SIGTERM immediately
└─ Wait for process exit, then SIGKILL if needed
```

### Operation Disposal Policy: Fail Immediately

**Decision**: Fail all in-flight operations immediately when shutdown begins.

**Rationale:**
- **Predictable latency**: Bounded shutdown time, no waiting for slow servers
- **Clear error semantics**: Operations receive explicit failure, not timeout
- **Simplicity**: No complex draining logic or partial completion tracking

**Operation Handling:**

| Operation Location | Shutdown Action |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Order queue - Not yet dequeued** | Never sent (writer loop stops dequeuing) |
| **Order queue - Currently writing** | Complete write, then writer loop exits |
| **Pending responses** | Fail with `REQUEST_FAILED` ("bridge: connection closing") when global timeout expires |
| **New operations** | Reject with `REQUEST_FAILED` ("bridge: connection closing") when attempting to enqueue |

**Why not abort mid-write**: Operations in the order queue may be partially written to stdin. Aborting mid-write corrupts the protocol stream.

### Writer Loop Shutdown Synchronization

**Problem**: Writer loop and shutdown sequence both write to stdin. Concurrent writes corrupt protocol stream.

**Solution**: Three-phase shutdown coordination.

**Phase 1: Signal Stop**
```rust
// Shutdown sequence
async fn graceful_shutdown(&self) {
    // 1. Transition to Closing state (new operations rejected)
    self.state.set(Closing);

    // 2. Signal writer loop to STOP dequeuing
    let _ = self.writer_stop_tx.send(());

    // Phase 2: Wait for writer to become idle...
}

// Writer loop
async fn writer_loop(&self) {
    loop {
        select! {
            operation = self.order_queue.recv() => {
                // Write operation...

                // After write, check if stop signaled
                if self.writer_stop_rx.try_recv().is_ok() {
                    break; // Exit loop
                }
            }
            _ = &mut self.writer_stop_rx => {
                break; // Exit immediately if idle
            }
        }
    }

    // Signal: writer is idle
    let _ = self.writer_idle_tx.send(());
}
```

**Phase 2: Wait for Idle**
```rust
// Shutdown sequence continues
async fn graceful_shutdown(&self) {
    // Wait for writer idle (or timeout)
    match tokio::time::timeout(
        Duration::from_secs(2),
        self.writer_idle_rx.recv()
    ).await {
        Ok(_) => log::debug!("Writer loop idle"),
        Err(_) => log::warn!("Writer loop timeout, forcing shutdown"),
    }

    // Phase 3: Exclusive stdin access...
}
```

**Phase 3: Exclusive Access**
```rust
// Shutdown sequence continues
async fn graceful_shutdown(&self) {
    // NOW safe to write to stdin (writer loop stopped)
    self.send_shutdown_request().await?;

    // Wait for shutdown response...
    // Send exit notification...
    // Kill process...
}
```

**Guarantees:**
- ✅ Writer loop stops dequeuing **before** shutdown writes to stdin
- ✅ No concurrent writes to stdin (sequential: writer → shutdown)
- ✅ Bounded wait (2s timeout prevents indefinite hang)
- ✅ Current write completes (no mid-write abortion)

**Why 2-second timeout**: Writer loop writes typically <100ms. 2s allows for slow disk I/O without indefinite hang.

### Shutdown Timeout Policy

**Global timeout**: Implementation-defined duration (typically 5-15 seconds) for entire shutdown sequence across all connections.

**Rationale for Global Timeout:**
- Multi-server coordination requires bounded total time
- User experience: Shutdown shouldn't hang indefinitely
- Per-server timeout could multiply (5 servers × 5s = 25s unacceptable)
- Fast servers don't wait for slow servers to time out

**Timeout Application:**
```rust
async fn shutdown_all_connections(connections: Vec<Connection>) {
    let global_timeout = Duration::from_secs(IMPL_DEFINED);

    tokio::time::timeout(global_timeout, async {
        // Shutdown all connections in parallel
        let tasks = connections.iter()
            .map(|conn| conn.graceful_shutdown());

        futures::future::join_all(tasks).await;
    }).await.unwrap_or_else(|_| {
        // Global timeout expired - force kill remaining
        force_kill_all(connections);
    });
}
```

### Initialization Shutdown: Abort Immediately

**Decision**: Abort initialization and proceed to shutdown.

**Sequence:**
```
Connection state: Initializing
Shutdown signal arrives
├─ Transition: Initializing → Closing
├─ Fail pending initialization request (if sent)
├─ Send exit notification (skip shutdown request - server not initialized)
├─ Kill process (SIGTERM → SIGKILL)
└─ Transition: Closing → Closed
```

**Rationale:**
- Initialization may hang (slow server, network issue)
- Waiting for initialization during shutdown adds unbounded latency
- Server hasn't completed initialization—LSP shutdown request invalid
- Exit notification sufficient for cleanup

### Multi-Connection Shutdown: Parallel with Global Timeout

**Decision**: Shut down all connections in parallel with single global timeout.

**Coordination Strategy:**

```rust
async fn shutdown_router() {
    // 1. Stop accepting new requests
    mark_router_shutting_down();

    // 2. Fail all pending routing decisions
    fail_pending_routes();

    // 3. Shutdown all connections in parallel
    let all_connections = connection_pool.all_connections();

    tokio::time::timeout(GLOBAL_TIMEOUT, async {
        let tasks = all_connections.iter()
            .map(|conn| async move {
                match conn.state() {
                    Failed => conn.cleanup_only(),      // Skip LSP handshake
                    _ => conn.graceful_shutdown(),      // Full LSP sequence
                }
            });

        futures::future::join_all(tasks).await;
    }).await.unwrap_or_else(|_| {
        // Global timeout - force kill stragglers
        force_kill_all(all_connections);
    });

    // 4. Clean up router resources
    cleanup_router_state();
}
```

**Why Parallel:**
- **Bounded total time**: N servers shut down in O(1) time, not O(N)
- **Independent failures**: Hung server doesn't block others
- **User experience**: 3 servers × 5s sequential = 15s vs 5s parallel

## Consequences

### Positive

**LSP Protocol Compliance:**
- Servers receive proper shutdown request → exit notification sequence
- Allows servers to flush buffers, save state, release locks
- Prevents cache corruption from abrupt termination

**Bounded Shutdown Latency:**
- Global timeout ensures shutdown completes in bounded time
- Fail-fast operation disposal (no draining) prevents hang
- Parallel multi-connection shutdown: O(1) not O(N)

**Clear Error Semantics:**
- Operations in flight receive explicit errors, not timeout
- New operations rejected immediately during shutdown (Closing state)
- Users see "bridge: connection closing" error, not silent hang

**Resource Cleanup:**
- SIGTERM → SIGKILL sequence ensures process termination
- No zombie processes or leaked file descriptors
- Lock files and caches properly released

**Multi-Server Resilience:**
- Hung server doesn't block shutdown of healthy servers
- Failed connections use fast path (skip LSP handshake)
- Global timeout prevents indefinite hang

### Negative

**No Operation Draining:**
- Queued operations never reach server (writer loop stops dequeuing)
- May surprise users expecting "finish pending work"
- Trade-off: Predictable shutdown time vs completion

**Failed Connections Bypass LSP:**
- Servers with Failed state don't receive shutdown request
- May leave caches in inconsistent state
- Mitigation: Servers should handle abrupt termination (crash recovery)

**Global Timeout Pressure:**
- Fast servers must wait for slow servers (up to timeout)
- Very slow servers force-killed even if making progress
- Alternative (per-server timeout) has worse UX (unbounded total time)

**Initialization Abort Abrupt:**
- Servers in Initializing state killed without completing setup
- May leave partial initialization state
- Trade-off: Shutdown latency vs initialization completion

### Neutral

**Implementation-Defined Timeout:**
- Flexibility for different deployment scenarios
- Must be documented/configurable for operators

**Closing State Overhead:**
- Adds complexity to state machine
- Necessary to prevent shutdown race conditions

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Sequential Multi-Connection Shutdown

Shut down connections one at a time with individual timeouts.

**Rejected Reasons:**

1. **Unbounded total time**: N servers × timeout = potentially very long wait (3 servers × 5s = 15s)
2. **Poor user experience**: User waits for each server sequentially
3. **Slow server blocks all**: First server hangs → all others wait
4. **No benefit over parallel**: Independent connections can shut down concurrently

**Why parallel is better**: Bounded total time (global timeout), better UX, fault isolation.

### Alternative 2: Drain Operations Before Shutdown

Continue processing pending operations until complete before shutting down.

**Rejected Reasons:**

1. **Unbounded shutdown time**: Slow operations could delay shutdown indefinitely
2. **Complexity**: Must track partial completion, handle new operations during drain
3. **LSP violation risk**: New operations arriving while draining create race conditions
4. **User expectation mismatch**: Users expect shutdown to be fast, not "finish all work first"

**Why fail-fast is better**: Predictable latency, simpler implementation, clear error semantics.

### Alternative 3: No Writer Loop Synchronization

Skip synchronization, just send shutdown request whenever ready.

**Rejected Reasons:**

1. **Protocol stream corruption**: Concurrent writes to stdin cause byte-level interleaving
2. **LSP violation**: Corrupted JSON-RPC stream causes parse errors
3. **Hard to debug**: Intermittent failures due to race conditions
4. **No recovery**: Once stream corrupted, connection unusable

**Why synchronization is essential**: Protocol correctness requires serialized stdin writes.
