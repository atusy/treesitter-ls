# ADR-0016: LS Bridge Server Pool Coordination

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Date** | 2026-01-07 |

**Related**:
- [ADR-0014](0014-ls-bridge-async-connection.md): Single-connection async I/O
- [ADR-0015](0015-ls-bridge-message-ordering.md): Single-server message ordering

**Phasing**: See [ADR-0013](0013-ls-bridge-implementation-phasing.md) — Phase 1 (routing), Phase 2 (rate-limited respawn), Phase 3 (aggregation).

## Scope

This ADR defines how to coordinate **multiple downstream language server connections** from a single bridge. It covers:
- Server pool lifecycle (spawn, initialize, shutdown)
- Request routing to appropriate server(s)
- Document lifecycle per downstream server
- Notification handling (drop, forward, pass-through)

## Context

The bridge manages connections to multiple downstream language servers. Even in Phase 1, multiple servers exist (e.g., pyright for Python, lua-ls for Lua). Each connection follows ADR-0014 (async I/O) and ADR-0015 (message ordering).

### Key Challenges

1. **Lifecycle Management**: How do we spawn, initialize, and shut down multiple servers?
2. **Request Routing**: Given a request for a language, which server should receive it?
3. **Document State**: How do we track document lifecycle per downstream server?
4. **Partial Failures**: What happens when some servers initialize successfully but others fail?

## Decision

**Adopt a phased approach: start with single-LS-per-language routing, extend to multi-LS aggregation in Phase 3.**

### Phase 1: Single-LS-per-Language (Current)

Each language maps to exactly one downstream server. Routing is simple: language → server.

**No-Provider Handling:** Return `REQUEST_FAILED` with clear message ("bridge: no provider for hover in python") to keep misconfiguration visible.

## Architecture

```

**Phase 1 Design:**
- **RequestRouter**: Routes by `languageId` to single server
- **Per-Connection Isolation**: Each downstream connection maintains its own actor (ADR-0015)
- **No Aggregation**: Single server per language, no fan-out

**Phase 3 Extension**: ResponseAggregator for multi-LS fan-out (see Future Extensions).

### Request ID Semantics

**Decision**: Use upstream request IDs directly for downstream servers.

**Phase 1 Flow** (single server per language):
```
Client (editor)          kakehashi           Downstream Server
     ├─ hover ID=42 ────→ Router ──────────────→ pyright (ID=42)
     ◀─ result ─────────────────────────────────◀
```

**Benefits:**
- Request ID consistent across client → bridge → server
- Simple state management (one pending entry per request)
- No ID transformation needed

### Routing (Phase 1)

In Phase 1, routing is simple: `languageId` → single server.

```rust
// Phase 1: Simple language-based routing
fn route_request(language_id: &str) -> Option<&Connection> {
    self.connections.get(language_id)
}
```

**Phase 3 Extension**: Multi-LS routing strategies (SingleByCapability, FanOut) — see Future Extensions.

### Server Lifecycle Management

**Parallel Initialization:**

Multiple downstream servers initialize in parallel since each is independent:

```
┌─────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│ Bridge  │     │ pyright  │     │  lua-ls  │
└────┬────┘     └────┬─────┘     └────┬─────┘
     │──initialize──▶│                │
     │──initialize───────────────────▶│  (parallel, no wait)
     │◀──result──────│                │  (pyright responds first)
     │──initialized─▶│                │
     │──didOpen─────▶│                │  (pyright ready for Python)
     │◀──result───────────────────────│  (lua-ls responds later)
     │──initialized──────────────────▶│
     │──didOpen──────────────────────▶│  (lua-ls ready for Lua)
```

**Key Points:**
- **Parallel `initialize`**: Send to all servers concurrently
- **Independent lifecycle**: Each server proceeds as soon as it responds
- **No global barrier**: Fast servers start handling requests immediately

**Partial Initialization Failure:**

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| All servers succeed | Normal operation |
| Some servers fail | Continue with working servers, respawn failed |
| All servers fail | Bridge reports errors, continues respawning |

**Future Extension (Phase 2)**: Rate-limited respawn to prevent respawn storms.

**Per-Downstream Document Lifecycle:**

Maintain the latest host-document snapshot per downstream. When a slower server reaches `didOpen`, send the full text as of "now", not as of when the first downstream opened.

**Document Lifecycle States** (per downstream, per URI):

```
States: Opened | Closed

Default: Closed (absent entry = Closed)

Transitions:
- Closed → Opened         (didOpen sent to downstream)
- Opened → Closed         (didClose sent to downstream)
```

**Why `Closed` as default**: From the downstream server's perspective, "never opened" and "was opened, now closed" are functionally equivalent—both require `didOpen` before any document operations. Using `Closed` as the default simplifies re-opening: it's just the normal `Closed → Opened` transition.

**Notification Handling by State:**

| Notification | Closed State (default) | Opened State |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------|
| `didOpen` | **SEND**, transition to **Opened** | Unexpected (log warning) |
| `didChange` | **DROP** (didOpen contains current state) | **FORWARD** |
| `didSave` | **DROP** | **FORWARD** |
| `willSave` | **DROP** | **FORWARD** |
| `didClose` | Suppress (already closed) | **FORWARD**, transition to **Closed** |

**Why drop instead of queue**: The `didOpen` notification contains the complete document text at send time. Accumulated client edits are included. Dropping `didChange` before `didOpen` avoids duplicate state updates.

**Connection Termination**: When a connection enters `Closed` state (graceful shutdown, crash, or respawn), all document lifecycle entries for that downstream are discarded. A respawned connection starts with all documents in `Closed` (default) state, requiring fresh `didOpen` notifications.

### Notification Pass-Through

**Diagnostics and other server-initiated notifications do NOT require aggregation.**

```
pyright  ──publishDiagnostics──►  bridge  ──publishDiagnostics──►  upstream
ruff     ──publishDiagnostics──►  bridge  ──publishDiagnostics──►  upstream
                                  (pass-through, no merge)
```

The bridge:
1. Receives notification from downstream
2. Transforms URI (virtual → host document URI)
3. Forwards to upstream client

The client (e.g., VSCode) automatically aggregates diagnostics from multiple sources per LSP standard behavior.

**Other Pass-Through Notifications:**
- `$/progress` — Already forwarded via notification channel
- `window/logMessage` — Forwarded as-is
- `window/showMessage` — Forwarded as-is

### Cancellation Propagation

See [ADR-0015 § Cancellation Forwarding](0015-ls-bridge-message-ordering.md#5-cancellation-forwarding) for single-connection cancellation semantics.

**Multi-Connection Coordination (Phase 3)**: Router forwards `$/cancelRequest` to all connections that received the original fan-out request.

## Future Extensions

### Phase 3: Multi-Server Backpressure Coordination

When routing notifications to multiple servers for the same language (Phase 3), if one server's queue is full, notifications are handled independently per server.

**Decision**: Accept state divergence under extreme backpressure (non-atomic broadcast).

```
Router sends didSave to pyright + ruff (both handle Python):
├─ pyright: queue full → DROP (per ADR-0015)
└─ ruff: queue OK → FORWARD

Result: State divergence (recoverable via next didChange)
```

**Rationale**: Servers already handle being attached at arbitrary points in a document's lifetime.

### Phase 3: Response Aggregation Strategies

> **Note**: This section describes Phase 3 multi-LS-per-language features. Phase 1 uses single-server routing.

For fan-out **requests** (with `id`), configure aggregation per method:

```rust
enum AggregationStrategy {
    /// Return first successful response, cancel others.
    /// On first success: immediately send $/cancelRequest to remaining servers,
    /// discard any late responses.
    FirstWins,

    /// Wait for all, merge array results (candidate lists only)
    MergeAll {
        dedup_key: Option<String>,  // e.g., 'label' for completions
        max_items: Option<usize>,
    },

    /// Wait for all, return highest priority non-null result
    Ranked {
        priority: Vec<String>,
    },
}
```

**Aggregation Stability Rules:**
- **Per-request timeout conditions**: Timeout applies **only when n ≥ 2 downstream servers participate**
  - SingleByCapability: No per-request timeout (wait for single server, liveness timeout protects)
  - FanOut with n=1: No per-request timeout (functionally equivalent to single)
  - FanOut with n≥2: Per-request timeout applies (default: 5s explicit, 2s incremental)
- **Per-request timeout behavior**: On timeout, return whatever results available **without sending $/cancelRequest**
  - Downstream servers continue processing and send responses
  - Late responses **discarded** by router but **reset liveness timeout** (heartbeat for connection health)
  - **Memory management**: Request entry removed from `pending_responses` after returning partial results
- **Partial results**: If at least one downstream succeeds, respond with successful `result` using LSP-native fields (e.g., for CompletionList: `{ "isIncomplete": true, "items": [...] }`)
- **Total failure**: If all downstreams fail or time out, respond with `ResponseError` (`REQUEST_FAILED`)

**Aggregation Error Messages:**

| Scenario | Error Code | Message |
|----------|------------|---------|
| All servers timeout, no responses | `REQUEST_FAILED` | "bridge: aggregation timeout, no responses received" |
| All servers return errors | `REQUEST_FAILED` | "bridge: all downstream servers failed" |
| No servers configured for method | `REQUEST_FAILED` | "bridge: no provider for {method} in {language}" |

### Phase 3: Configuration Example

```yaml
# Phase 3: Multiple servers per language with aggregation
languages:
  markdown:
    bridges:
      python:
        # Multiple servers for Python
        priority: ["ruff", "pyright"]  # Prioritize ruff when capability overlaps

        # Per-method aggregation config:
        aggregations:
          textDocument/completion:
            strategy: merge_all      # Safe: candidates, user selects one
            dedup_key: label
          textDocument/codeAction:
            strategy: merge_all      # Safe: proposals, user executes one
          # hover, definition: use default (single_by_capability)
          # formatting, rename: MUST use single_by_capability

languageServers:
  pyright:
    cmd: [pyright-langserver, --stdio]
    languages: [python]
  ruff:
    cmd: [ruff, server]
    languages: [python]  # Same language as pyright
```

## Consequences

### Positive

**Simple Routing (Phase 1):**
- Language → single server mapping is straightforward
- No aggregation overhead for common cases

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Partial initialization failures allow working servers to continue
- Fault isolation: One crashed server doesn't affect others

**Parallel Initialization:**
- Multiple servers initialize concurrently without global barriers
- Faster servers start handling requests immediately

**No Silent Failures:**
- Missing providers surface as explicit `REQUEST_FAILED` errors
- Users can diagnose configuration issues immediately

**Extensible Foundation:**
- Phase 1 architecture supports future multi-LS extension (Phase 3)
- Single-server configurations continue to work unchanged

### Negative

**Single Server Limitation (Phase 1):**
- Cannot use multiple servers for same language (e.g., pyright + ruff) until Phase 3

**Coordination Complexity:**
- Per-downstream document state tracking required
- State divergence possible under extreme backpressure

### Neutral

**Existing Tests:**
- Current single-server tests remain valid

**Diagnostics:**
- Pass-through by design — client handles aggregation

**Phase 3 Trade-offs** (future):
- Aggregation adds complexity and latency
- Configuration surface grows with multi-LS support

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Sequential Initialization

Initialize servers one at a time, waiting for each to complete.

**Rejected Reasons:**

1. **Increased startup time**: N servers × init time = long wait
2. **No benefit**: Server initialization is independent, parallelization is free
3. **Poor UX**: Users wait for slowest server before any work

**Why parallel is better**: Faster servers can start handling requests immediately.

### Alternative 2: Global Initialization Barrier

Wait for ALL servers to initialize before handling any requests.

**Rejected Reasons:**

1. **Slow server blocks all**: One slow server delays entire system
2. **No partial utility**: Fast servers sit idle waiting
3. **Fragile**: One failure delays everything

**Why per-server independence is better**: Each language proceeds as soon as its server is ready.

### Alternative 3: Drop Notifications Silently Before didOpen

Silently discard notifications instead of explicit DROP with state tracking.

**Rejected Reasons:**

1. **Hidden behavior**: Hard to debug why notifications don't reach server
2. **No state visibility**: Can't tell if notification was dropped or queued
3. **Inconsistent**: Some notifications reach server, others don't

**Why explicit state is better**: Clear rules for notification handling based on document lifecycle state.

## Configuration Example (Phase 1)

```yaml
# Phase 1: One server per language (simple)
languages:
  markdown:
    bridges:
      python:
        server: pyright          # Single server for Python
      lua:
        server: lua-ls           # Single server for Lua
      toml:
        server: taplo            # Single server for TOML

languageServers:
  pyright:
    cmd: [pyright-langserver, --stdio]
    languages: [python]
  lua-ls:
    cmd: [lua-language-server, --stdio]
    languages: [lua]
  taplo:
    cmd: [taplo, lsp, stdio]
    languages: [toml]
```

**Phase 3 Configuration Example** (future): See Future Extensions for multi-LS aggregation config.
